      <h1>Choose your heat press</h1>
      <article class="main-article">
        <p>The first step is to find the right heat press. Like mentioned above a heat press can be used for many different projects. So it's best to choose one based on the type of projects your looking into.  </p>
        <p>
For example, you can get a heatpress that is designed for only fabrics such as T-shirts and hoodies. If this is the route you choose you should then look into the size machine you would want. If you plan to print on small items such as bibs, or small logo designs you could purchase a smaller machine. While, if you wanted a large design with a more full coverage on a hoodie you would need a larger heat press. There are also 5-in-1 heat presses that can be used for multiple uses allowing you to print on Shirts, hats, 2 mugs sizes, and plates.

      <h1>Choose your material</h1>
      <article class="main-article">
        <p>Unfortunately, you can’t use just any fabric for heat pressing. Some of them are sensitive to heat and high temperatures would melt them. You should stay away from thin materials and synthetics. Instead, print on cotton, lycra, nylon, polyester, and spandex.</p>

        <p>This is where you bring your creative side to life.</p>
        <p>Almost any image can be printed and pressed onto the item of your choice. First, create your logo or image. This can be done on any website or application of your choice. A few you can use are Canva, Photoshop and Adobe illustrator. If you are not on the creative side you can buy designs from logo creators and print and press them. </p>

      <h1>Print your design</h1>
      <article class="main-article">
        <p>In order to print your design, you must have either an inkjet printer or Vinyl cutter and it's highly reccomended to use transfer paper. </p>

        <p>An inkjet printer lets you print out a basic design much like a printer and transfer it. A vinyl cutter on the other hand is a computer controlled blade that cuts the outline of your design on the heat transfer vinyl, leaves you with a design that you can then heat press on your t-shirt.</p>
        
        <p>Next is the transfer paper. Transfer paper is a special thin type of paper much like wax and parchment paper that allows you to tranfer your design to the shirt without putting to much heat and burning the vinyl.</p>

      <h1>Prepare heat press</h1>
      <article class="main-article">
        <p> Every heat press machine includes a timer and allows you to set your desired temperature and pressure. Note that the press should be open when it’s being prepared.</p>
<p>
Once you’ve turned your heat press on, set your temperature. You do this by turning the thermostat knob clockwise (or using the arrow buttons on some presses) until you’ve reached your desired heat setting. This will activate the heating light. Once the light is off, you’ll know that it has reached the temperature you want. You can turn the knob back at this point, but the light will keep going on and off to maintain the heat.</p>
        <p>Next, set the pressure. Turn the pressure knob until you’ve reached the setting you want. Thicker materials usually require more pressure, while thinner ones don’t need it.

You should aim for medium to high pressure. It’s also good to experiment until you’ve found the level that you think gives the best results. On some presses, a lower pressure setting makes it more difficult to lock down the handle.</p>

      <h1>Place fabric on press</h1>
      <article class="main-article">
        <p>It’s important that the material is straightened when placed inside the press. Any folds will lead to a bad print. You can use the press to preheat the clothing item for 5 to 10 seconds to remove creases.

        <p>Once you’ve correctly placed the clothing item and the print into the press, you can bring the handle down. It should lock. Then, Set the timer based on your transfer paper instructions, usually between 10 seconds and 1 minute.

Once the time has passed, open the press and take out the shirt. Peel off the transfer paper while it’s still hot. You should now see your design successfully transferred onto your clothing item.</p>

      <h1r>After care</h1>
      <article class="main-article">
        <p>You should leave your shirt to rest for at least 24 hours before washing it. This helps the print to set in. When you do wash it, turn it inside out so that there isn’t any friction. Don’t use detergents that are too strong, as they can affect the print. </p>
